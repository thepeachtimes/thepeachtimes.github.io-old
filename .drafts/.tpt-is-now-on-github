With google <a href="https://thepeachtimes.blogspot.com/2019/11/google-keeps-getting-rid-of-too-many-of.html">getting rid of</a> a lot of their services, we decided to move away from Blogger, a blogging website owned by google, because it seems like google is neglecting it.
We are now using GitHub Pages, which has static pages, using a blogging script called <a href="https://github.com/lickthecheese/bs">bs</a> because its lightweight and customizable.
