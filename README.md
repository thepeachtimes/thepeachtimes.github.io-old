# bs
maybe a competitor to @lukesmithxyz's lb?

actually probably not its bad lol


## what is this
this is a small lightweight static file bash blogging script, similar
to bb (bash blog) or lb (@lukesmithxyz's blogging script)

you should probably use one of those, this one is bad lol, im just bored
and dont want my contributings to be blank

**note**: `bs` is **only** a script for posting to a blog website, and
will not be able to edit/delete posts unless you do it manually. if you
would like those features, please use `lb` or `bashblog` instead.

**warning**: user input is supposed to be trusted, and is not sanitized. dont
connect some user interface to `bs` and expect it to be secure

## how to use it
edit stuff in `./settings` and then put a text file, with the name being the
title seperated with hyphens, into `./.drafts/` (or whatever you set it in
the settings file). then just run bs in a terminal and select what to post,
and it should post it
